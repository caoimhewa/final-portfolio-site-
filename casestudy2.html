    <h5>Brief</h5>
    <p class="main">We were given the task to design a site for Kids to help teach them about five elements in the periodic table. <br> <br> I wanted to make mine fun and engaging. I also wanted to create a theme behind the project to make it more exciting for kids. This is when I came up with the 'The Secret Garden of Elements’. </p></div>

        <h6>Process</h6>
        <p class="main2"> Firstly I created a user persona to help me keep my design on track. I then decided to research the content around my five chosen elements. It was important to choose elements that could be found in the secret garden.<br> <br> A user flow was my next step. I wanted to make sure that it was simple to navigate through. It was important to make it as accessible as possible for kids to help them learn. <br> <br> I then started to explore colour palettes. I wanted to use strong colours, but keep it vibrant and mysterious at the same time.  </p>

         <h6>Theme</h6>
        <p class="main3">The theme for my site plays a big role. Inspiration from the secret garden helped me to develop the idea of the secret garden of elements. <br> <br> I loved the book as a child and thought it might be relatable for many others. I began to sketch out illustrations for the webpage. I wanted to create a sense of mystery somehow to help engage the kids.  <br> <br> The idea of the first screen is that you have to almost 'unlock' the site to enter it. This helps to start the mystery. </p>>

         <h6>Solution</h6>
        <p class="main3"> The idea behind the site is to make learning elements fun. Kids can go through the opening page by pressing a button to enter. They then will be able to see the garden. The site explains that there are elements hidden in the illustration. The way to figure out where they are is by clicking on each one which will then take them to a new page. On the page, they will then see an illustration from the garden that contains the element. <br> <br> The content on the page explains the basics of the element and then gives examples of where else it can be found.<br> <br> I focused a lot on illustration to make it as visual as possible to try and keep it exciting.<br> <br> You can view it <a href="https://caoimhewa.github.io/elements_site/">here ♥</a></p>
