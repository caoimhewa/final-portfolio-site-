<h1>Project Brief</h1>
<hr>
<p>We were given the task to create an app design under the topic of travel. We had to focus on making the app illustrative </p>

<h2>The Process</h2>
<hr>
<p>I began to think of what area of the topic that I wanted to focus on and how I would like it to look. I wanted to focus it on soemthig I myself would be itnerested in usuing and what I felt like there wasnt an app for. I was trying tho think about when you travel across cities around the globe how hard ot can be to find thoses amazing beskoe, one off boutiques. Wouldn't it be so useful if there was somehthing there to help you find these stores?  </p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>
<hr>
<p>The app I decied to design is called Quirkey. Its purpose is to locate besoke boutiques in cities around the world. The design of the app is meant to exude dreamyness through the colour scheme and illustratin style. The idea behind this compliment the idea of going waay to knew cities adn unkown places to dicover- just like in your dreams. The pastels create a soft asttetic with feminine vibes.</p>
