     <h5>Brief</h5>
    <p class="main">We were given the task to design 12 icons, all in a set. It could be any topic of choice <br> <br> I wanted it to be as creative as possible. With this task, I really wanted to challenge my imagination </p></div>

        <h6>Process</h6>
        <p class="main2"> Firstly, I began to brainstorm my ideas. After multiple mind maps and sketches I had narrowed my ideas down to bottles. I thought it would be a challenge to try and illustrate glass so I wanted to work around this idea. <br> <br> As I love detail I really wanted to focus my project on that. I began to think and sketch out different bottle shapes taking inspiration from perfume bottles. The more I sketched, the more I thought about the idea of potion bottles. This seemed perfect as I could be as creative as I wanted with my designs.   </p>

         <h6>Icons</h6>
        <p class="main2"> The icon creation began. I was really excited about this project as I could be as imaginative as I wanted to be. I decided to come up with all the potion types first which was really fun. I then based the designs of the bottles off the purpose of the potions <br> <br> The shapes of each potion bottle are meant to mirror the potion itself. Whether it be softer or harder edges or tall or small, I have tried to mirror the intent of the spell. <br> <br> The elements on the bottles are either direct symbols of the potions themselves or inspired by the theme </p>

    <div class="content-half light-pink">
        <h6>Site</h6>
        <p class="main2">Lastly, I created a site to showcase my finished designs. I decided to stick to a very simple layout as I wanted to make sure the focus would be on the illustrations. <br> <br> The content on the website simply explains the effect of the potion. It gives a list of the different ingredients contained. <br> <br> I also included buttons to download the icons.<br> <br> You can view it <a href="https://caoimhewa.github.io/icons/">here ♥</a></p>
