     <h5>Brief</h5>
    <p class="main">We were given the task to design a set of 12 icons. It could be any topic of choice. <br> <br> My aim was to be as creative as possible. I really wanted this project to challenge my imagination. </p></div>

        <h6>Process</h6>
        <p class="main2"> Firstly, I began to brainstorm my ideas. After multiple mind maps and sketches I had narrowed my ideas down to bottles. I thought it would be a challenge to try and illustrate glass so I wanted to work around this idea. <br> <br> As I love detail I really wanted to focus my project on that. I began to think and sketch out different bottle shapes taking inspiration from perfume bottles. The more I sketched, the more I thought about the idea of potion bottles. This seemed perfect as I could be as creative as I wanted with my designs.   </p>

         <h6>Icons</h6>
        <p class="main2"> The icon creation began. I was really excited about this project as I could be as imaginative as I wanted to be. I decided to come up with all the potion types first which was really fun. I then based the designs of the bottles off the purpose of the potions. <br> <br> The shape of each potion bottle is meant to reflect the potion itself. Whether it is tall or small, or has softer or harder edges, I tried to mirror the intent of the spell. <br> <br> The images on the bottles, either directly symbolise the potions themselves, or are inspired by the theme. </p>

    <div class="content-half light-pink">
        <h6>Site</h6>
        <p class="main2">Lastly, I created a site to showcase my finished designs. I decided to stick to a very simple layout as I wanted to make sure the focus would be on the illustrations. <br> <br> The content on the website simply explains the effect of the potion. It gives a list of the different ingredients contained. <br> <br> I also included buttons to download the icons.<br> <br> You can view it <a href="https://caoimhewa.github.io/icons/">here ♥</a></p>
